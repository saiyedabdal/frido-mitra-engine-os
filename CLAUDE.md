# Frido Mitra — Engine OS (dashboard)

## What this is
Single-file static dashboard for Frido's affiliate program (Project: Frido Mitra / Buddy / Ambassador). It visualizes the program's operating model: 9 sequential macro engines (E1 Acquiring → E9 Retention) executed per affiliate channel (AC / SAC / SSC taxonomy: GT traders, physios, ortho doctors, IG whitelisted/new creators, YT long-form/shorts, campus ambassadors, households, plus a GLOBAL pseudo-channel for shared platform steps).

Views (hash-routed, all rendered from embedded data):
- **Dashboard** — signature element: each channel as a 9-station "engine line"; station color = dominant GTM status; blue underdot = GLOBAL shared coverage; stations click through to the Cockpit. Plus KPI cards, POC markers (500·500·500 recruits / 6-month POC / 3-month payback), and a show-stopper feed.
- **Registry** — AC/SAC tree, legacy L1–L4 mapping, per-channel rollups.
- **Cockpit** — one channel end-to-end across E1–E9; GLOBAL rows shown dashed/de-emphasized; coverage gaps called out.
- **Lens** — one engine across all channels; stacked status bars; explicit coverage-gap banner.

## Data & provenance (important)
- All data is embedded in `index.html` as three constants: `ENGINES`, `CHANNELS`, `LEDGER`.
- Ledger grain: one row = one sub-engine for one leaf channel in one engine. Row id = `CH-Ex-NN`.
- `src:"v0"` rows come verbatim-ish from the master Google Sheet (sheet id `1ifYKFph9DSIsQDPoYrjhbBk7bCWrN-KA0QuL-jeT_y0`). `src:"draft"` rows are proposals awaiting Sprint-1 confirmation. **Never silently invent new v0 rows — new content is `draft` until Abdal confirms.**
- The Google Sheet is the system of record (see `docs/engine-os-design.md` §2); this app is the front-end. GTM chip clicks persist to `localStorage` key `fm_gtm_v1` (browser-local only, by design in v1).

## Stack & constraints
- Pure static, no build step, no framework: one `index.html`, vanilla JS, hash router. Keep it single-file unless a change genuinely requires splitting.
- Fonts: Bricolage Grotesque (display) · Instrument Sans (body) · IBM Plex Mono (codes/data), via Google Fonts.
- Design tokens live in `:root`. Dark control-room theme: `--ink #101319`, panels `#171B23/#1D222C`. Status spectrum carries meaning — slate = Not started, saffron `#F0A231` = In build, sky `#5AA7F0` = Testable, jade `#34C388` = Live, ember `#E5544B` = stoppers. Don't add new accent colors casually; the palette is the information.
- Quality floor: responsive to mobile, `:focus-visible` outlines, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected. Preserve these in every change.

## Deploy (Netlify)
- Production site: **frido-mitra-engine-os.netlify.app**
- Site ID: `cd2203a6-e56e-4c25-a01a-50e808e2bbc1` (team: Founders Office / `saiyedabdal`)
- GitHub repo: **github.com/saiyedabdal/frido-mitra-engine-os** (public)
- **Continuous deployment is LIVE**: any push to `main` → Netlify auto-builds & publishes to production (publish dir `.`, no build cmd). Wired via a Netlify deploy key + a GitHub push webhook → `api.netlify.com/hooks/github` (deploy-key method, not the GitHub App).
- ⚠️ Because `main` auto-publishes, treat `main` as production. Do real work on feature branches → open a PR → review the Netlify **deploy preview** → merge to `main` (that merge is the prod approval). Don't commit straight to `main` unless you intend it live immediately.
- Manual fallback: `netlify link --id cd2203a6-e56e-4c25-a01a-50e808e2bbc1` then `netlify deploy --prod`.

## Operating rule
**Never deploy to production without Abdal's explicit approval of a change summary.** Deploy previews / local serves are fine without approval; production is not.

## Roadmap (v1.1+ candidates, in rough order)
1. Live data: replace embedded seed with a fetch from a Google Apps Script `doGet` JSON endpoint on the master Sheet (keep embedded seed as offline fallback).
2. Owner assignment pass once Day 1–2 owner mapping lands (registry + ledger `owner` fields are mostly "Unassigned" by design right now).
3. ~~GitHub repo + Netlify auto-deploy.~~ **Done** — public repo; push-to-`main` auto-deploys to production (deploy key + GitHub webhook, verified). Optional upgrade: connect the Netlify **GitHub App** in the UI (Site → Build & deploy → Link repository → GitHub) to get deploy-preview status checks posted back onto PRs — the current deploy-key wiring handles builds but not PR status checks.
4. METRICS layer per design doc Phase 2: RR actuals (affiliates, links, CTA clicks, conversions) feeding the Dashboard; later BigQuery `frido-429506` CM2 for E7.

## Context docs
- `docs/engine-os-design.md` — full system design (schema, views, 14-day plan). Read before structural changes.
